# DeepGhost 👻

**DeepGhost** is an AI-powered search and download engine capable of crawling content from the **surface web**, **deep web**, and **dark web** — even through delays, redirect loops, and disguised download paths.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 Surface web search (via DuckDuckGo)
- 🌐 Deep web exploration (via AI-guided heuristics)
- 🕶️ Dark web crawling (.onion support via Tor)
- 🧠 AI-powered decision engine to detect final downloadable links
- ⚙️ Smart delay bypass & redirect tracing
- 💾 Auto-download files from hidden sources

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dndeepghost/deepghost.git
cd deepghost
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 🔐 For dark web crawling, make sure you have **Tor Browser** or **Tor service** running in the background.

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py --query "target keyword"
```

You can also specify modes:
```bash
python main.py --query "bitcoin wallet dump" --mode dark
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Searches via DuckDuckGo / Custom engines.
2. Uses AI to detect:
   - Real vs fake links
   - Hidden downloads behind redirects
3. Can bypass delays, JS countdowns, and auto-redirects.
4. Downloads final file or captures target data.
